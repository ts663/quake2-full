To play this Sonic the Hedgehog mod, start the game and load into *DEATHMATCH*.

The mod allows you to move at high speeds and defeat enemies like Sonic would. The following buttons map to specific actions:

F (in air) - homing attack
C (hold) (on the ground) - charge spin dash
C (in air) - stomp dive

The armor shards act as your rings, and your health is based on how many rings you have. If you take damage, you will lose some rings. If you don't have any rings when you take damage, game over.
